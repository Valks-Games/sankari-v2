## What is Sankari?
Sankari ("hero" in Finnish) is a non-profit F2P 2D Platformer about a hero whose village gets raided by the evil king. The hero goes on a journey to free back the villagers that were captured and defeat the evil king. 

This project was created to gain experience in the C# Godot environment for the 2D Platform genre and to prove to myself that I can make a complete game. I hope in making this open source that others will also learn some things that I have learned.

The project will be considered complete when there is around 2 to 3 hours of fun and memorable content. Some of the major goals of the project include getting multiplayer to a playable state and making the code as flexible and as readable as possible.

## Setup
Download and install the [latest Godot 4 C# release](https://godotengine.org/). Use the GitHub Desktop App to clone the repo with all its submodules.

## Contributing
Currently looking for programmers to peer review my code.
